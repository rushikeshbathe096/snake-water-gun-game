# Snake Water Gun

A simple command-line Snake–Water–Gun game written in Python.

This project started as a basic implementation and is being gradually improved to focus on better structure, cleaner logic, and smarter computer behavior. The goal is not just to build a game, but to practice writing maintainable and extensible Python code.

## Current State
- Playable single-player game
- Computer opponent
- Input validation
- Function-based implementation

## Planned Improvements
- Modular project structure
- Adaptive computer strategy based on player behavior
- Player statistics and basic analytics
- Cleaner CLI experience

## How to Run
Tested on Linux / WSL with Python 3.

```bash
python main.py
